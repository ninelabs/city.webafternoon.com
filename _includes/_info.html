      <h1>What to Expect</h1>
      <p>Two keynote speakers and a dozen thought leaders bring the latest and greatest of the Web that&rsquo;s relevant to you. They&rsquo;ll be speaking but also leading group discussions and mingling with you. No tracks, no breakout rooms. Settle in for an afternoon with your tribe. Lean, fast-paced, and designed to spur conversation, you&rsquo;ll leave Web Afternoon inspired and informed. <strong>That&rsquo;s how ideas are born.</strong></p>
      <p>You won&rsquo;t find fancy flowers or dramatic lighting at Web Afternoon. We minimize the fluff to focus on providing quality content from people in the know, at a price you can afford. Your ticket to Web Afternoon is a vote of confidence in the community you love. <em>Every penny</em> from our events goes straight back to help local groups and meet-ups you love. We&rsquo;ve generated thousands of dollars so far for Web- and technology-focused groups, and we&rsquo;re just getting started.</p>
