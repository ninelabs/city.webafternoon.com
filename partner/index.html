    <h2>Partner Kit</h2>
   <!--  <p><b>Put your brand in front of hundreds of influencers, decision-makers, and social leaders.</b></p>
    <p>Be seen and heard by the people who influence our industry. These are your kind of people. Your customers, your evangelists, your fans. They appreciate your support, and there's no better way to show it than sponsor events they love.</p>

    <h4>What will you get?</h4>
    <p>Few communities support each other like people who work on the Web. If you want to reach the people who help share the future of online products and services, you need to be involved.</p>
    <p>See the packages and full attendee demographics in our <a href="/sponsor/2015SponsorshipGuide.pdf">Sponsorship Package</a>.</p>
